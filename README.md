## Code Challenge: Payment Transaction Dashboard

### Estimated time for completion: 30 minutes
**Problem Statement:**

You are tasked with reviewing and improving the functionality and structure of a basic payment transaction dashboard built with React.js and TypeScript. Your goal is to analyze the provided code and implement targeted improvements that align with best practices for performance, maintainability, and scalability.

This challenge is designed to evaluate your ability to quickly identify key issues, enhance functionality, and demonstrate best practices within a limited timeframe.


### Task Instructions:

#### Fix and Enhance Existing Functionality

Optimize the handleCheckTransactions function to improve performance and handle edge cases (e.g., empty transactions or invalid inputs).

#### Add Input Validation

Ensure users cannot add transactions with duplicate IDs or negative amounts.

#### Extend Functionality

Add a feature that calculates and dynamically displays the total sum of all transactions as new ones are added.

#### Optional Bonus Task

Style the application minimally to improve readability and usability. Use inline styles or basic CSS classes (this step is not mandatory).

***Important:*** All tasks should be completed and shared via a public repository. Ensure the repository includes:

- The complete code.

- A README.md file with instructions for running and testing the project.

- Clear commit messages documenting your progress.
